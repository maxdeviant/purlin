# Purlin

Purlin provides a common foundation for your [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) projects.

## Usage

To get started with Purlin you'll want to install it as a `devDependency`:

#### Yarn

```sh
yarn add -D purlin
```

#### npm

```sh
npm i -D purlin
```

Once Purlin is installed you can configure your desired scripts, like so:

```diff json
{
  "scripts": {
+    "format": "purlin format"
  }
}
```
